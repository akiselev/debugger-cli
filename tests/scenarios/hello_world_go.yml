# Go Hello World Test
# Tests Go debugging with Delve (dlv)
#
# NOTE: Delve uses TCP-based DAP connections rather than stdin/stdout.
# This test requires TCP-based DAP adapter support to be implemented.
# Currently expected to fail until that feature is added.

# Compile the test program with debug info
setup:
  - shell: "go build -gcflags='all=-N -l' -o tests/e2e/test_go tests/e2e/hello_world.go"

# Debug target configuration
target:
  program: "../e2e/test_go"
  args: []
  adapter: "go"

# Test steps
steps:
  # 1. Set a breakpoint at main.main
  - action: command
    command: "break main.main"
    expect:
      success: true

  # 2. Continue to the breakpoint
  - action: command
    command: "continue"

  # 3. Wait for stop at breakpoint
  - action: await
    timeout: 10
    expect:
      reason: "breakpoint"
      file: "hello_world.go"

  # 4. Step over to initialize x
  - action: command
    command: "next"

  # 5. Wait for step to complete
  - action: await
    timeout: 10
    expect:
      reason: "step"

  # 6. Step over to initialize y
  - action: command
    command: "next"

  - action: await
    timeout: 10
    expect:
      reason: "step"

  # 7. Step over to initialize sum
  - action: command
    command: "next"

  - action: await
    timeout: 10
    expect:
      reason: "step"

  # 8. Step past sum assignment to make variable visible
  - action: command
    command: "next"

  - action: await
    timeout: 10
    expect:
      reason: "step"

  # 9. Check local variables (now sum is available)
  - action: inspect_locals
    asserts:
      - name: "x"
        value_contains: "10"
      - name: "y"
        value_contains: "20"
      - name: "sum"
        value_contains: "30"

  # 9. Check stack trace
  - action: inspect_stack
    asserts:
      - index: 0
        function: "main.main"

  # 12. Continue to exit
  - action: command
    command: "continue"

  # 13. Wait for program exit (Delve sends "terminated" event)
  - action: await
    timeout: 10
    expect:
      reason: "terminated"
